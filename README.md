# GIT Command Automation

## Operations

- **_lazypush_**: The lazy way to add all to git stack, commit and push to current branch.

- **_switch-to_**: The custom command to checkout to a new branch with all the unstaged changes present in the current branch.

- **_remote-diff_**: The custom command to view the difference between the local and the remote of the specified branch.

- **_remote-log_**: The custom command helps you to view the commit logs between the local and remote changes of the given branch.

- **_hard-delete_**: The custom command to delete a branch both locally and remotely.

## Usage

### Linux/Debian-

- Clone this repository locally.

- Enter the local repository directory using `cd directory-name`

- Run the executable command file using `chmod +x git-coomand-name`

- Copy the executed `git-command.sh` to your `/user/bin` for git to identify the custom *git* command<br /> using `sudo cp git-command-name /usr/bin/git-command-name`

- Done! Now you are ready to use the custom git commands using `git command-name message/branch-name`<br /> example `git lazypush "test commit message"`
